# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This github page showcases my projects and provides an overview of my skills and experience.

## Methodology

Based on the requirements and bonus points mentioned, I have developed a web application with navigation to access different sites on the web and also deployed the application using Github Pages.

To meet the bonus points, I have implemented additional features:

- Responsiveness: My webpage has a responsive design, ensuring that the webpage adapts and displays correctly on various screen sizes and devices. This is achieved by using responsive CSS techniques such as media queries.

- CSS Flexbox: I have utilized CSS Flexbox to create complex layouts. These layout systems provide flexible and powerful ways to arrange elements on a webpage, allowing for better control over the design and structure.

- CSS Transitions / Animations: The application incorporates transitions or animations to enhance interactivity and visual appeal. By using it, I created smooth and gradual changes in property values.

- CSS methodology (BEM): I have employed a CSS methodology called BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) to organize my CSS classes. 

- Custom fonts: My application uses custom font, which adds a personal and distinctive touch to the design. The font used is called Mukta.

- Color palette: My webpage uses the nord color palette, to ensure a consistent and visually pleasing color scheme throughout the application. The nord color palette is known for its elegant and minimalistic design, with a focus on cool and muted tones.

- Accessibility: I have implemented accessibility best practices to make the application usable for users with disabilities. This includes using semantic HTML to provide meaningful structure and using appropriate HTML elements for their intended purposes. I have also included alt attributes in images to provide alternative text for screen readers and ensured good color contrast between elements for better readability.

- Cross-Browser Compatibility: I have ensured that my application displays and behaves correctly on different web browsers such as Chrome, Brave, Edge etc. 

Overall, by incorporating these features and following best practices, I have developed a web application that not only provides navigation to different sites but also offers a responsive design, complex layouts, interactive transitions/animations, organized CSS code, custom font, accessibility, and cross-browser compatibility.
